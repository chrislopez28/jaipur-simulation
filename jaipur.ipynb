    "## Highest Possible Starting Hand?\n",
    "A player could be dealt 5 diamond hands at the beginning of the game. A sale of 5 diamonds would be worth 29 rupees, **plus** the value of the 5-card bonus token (worth 8, 9, or 10 rupees). From the matches I have played, a winning game is often around 70 rupees, so to me having 37-39 rupees from the start of the game seems like an almost insurmountable position. \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\text{probability 5 diamonds} = \\frac{6\\choose 5}{52\\choose 5} = \\frac{6}{2598960} \\approx 0.0002\\%\n",

    "As a percentage it's hard to make any sense of this number. Perhaps a better way of thinking about it is *1 in 433,160*. So imagine going to a Clippers game with an attendance of ~19,000 people and they randomly select a fan attending the game for a chance to win a prize (say a new car). They then do the same thing for the *next 21 home games* so that 22 fans in total are selected. 1 fan out of these 22 selected fans is then selected to win the prize. Of course dealing out hands in Jaipur is much quicker and less expensive than attending a basketball game, but that's besides the point."
